Prerequisites:

You need to have OpenL plugins installed in eclipse

1. Create OpenL WebStudio project

   If org.openl.rules.webstudio project is already in eclipse workspace
   then skip this step

   File -> New -> Other...
   OpenL Tablets -> OpenL Tools -> OpenL WebStudio - Web based editing environment

2. Run build.xml in org.openl.tablets.demo project

   Use targets:

   deploy            -- prepares environment (by default in /openl folder)
   start_tomcat      -- starts tomcat and repository

Web Studio is available at url <a href="http://NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN:8080/webstudio">http://NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN:8080/webstudio</a>,
where NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN is your computer's IP address (due to the known issue with localhost you can not use "localhost" name )
To get your computer's IP address run <code>ipconfig</code> in command console

Default credentials are a1/a1 (login/password).

Demo Web Application (very simple) is at url   <a href="http://localhost:8080/demo">http://localhost:8080/demo</a>

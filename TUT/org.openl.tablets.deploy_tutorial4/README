Prerequisites:

You need to checkout to the same directory projects

org.openl.lib.apache.jackrabbit
org.openl.lib.apache.tomcat
org.openl.lib.cxf
org.openl.lib.jsf
org.openl.lib.springsource


Using:
ant start_tomcat      - starts tomcat server with webstudio and demo web applications
ant start_ruleservice - starts ruleservice

Note:
  Start ruleservice a while after tomcat is started as it hosts a JCR production repository available through 
RMI, to which both webstudio and ruleservice connect.

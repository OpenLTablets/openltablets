Prerequisites:

You need to have OpenL plugins installed in eclipse

Replace next properties in build file:
<property name="plugin.base.path" value="C:/Eclipse/plugins" />
<property name="openl.plugin.version" value="_5.0.5" />

with values valid for your environment:
<property name="plugin.base.path" value="<path to eclipse plugins directory where OpenL plugins are located>" />
<property name="openl.plugin.version" value="_<version of OpenL installed>" />

Notice: version should be with "_" (underscore) prefix.

Using:
ant start_tomcat      - starts tomcat server with webstudio and demo web applications
ant start_ruleservice - starts ruleservice

Note:
  Start ruleservice a after tomcat have been started(the message 
  "Server start in 12345 ms" is displayed in server console window) 
  as it hosts a JCR production repository available through 
RMI, to which both webstudio and ruleservice connect.


Web Studio is available at url <a href="http://NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN:8080/webstudio">http://NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN:8080/webstudio</a>, 
where NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN is your computer's IP address (due to the known issue with localhost you can not use "localhost" name )
To get your computer's IP address run <code>ipconfig</code> in command console 

Demo Web Application (very simple) ia at url   <a href="http://localhost:8080/demo">http://localhost:8080/demo</a>

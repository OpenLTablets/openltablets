<h1>OpenL Tablets Web Studio</h1>

<p>
One of the major objections we often hear from Business Users and IT guys alike, when pitching
OpenL Tablets approach, is that Excel files and tables are not very suitable for enterprise environment 
due to the lack of good management tools.
<p> 
We always argued that this concern could be alleviated
by rigorous organizational procedures and specialized technical tools. 
Once these are in a place
one starts to rip benefits of using "just Excel" as a Business Knowledge Management Tool.
<p>
The first step in this direction was an introduction of OpenL Tablet Eclipse Plugin that treated Excel 
files as a conventional <i>source code</i>. It "compiled" Excel files and showed errors that could 
be easily navigated to the source of the problem. 
<p>
If error happened in runtime, it would produce a console link
similar to the Java stack trace that also would point to the actual problem source directly inside Excel file. 
This functionality is still not available anywhere else<sup><a href="#discl2">(1)</a></sup>.<br/>
<p>
Now the technologies once pioneered in OpenL Eclipse Plugin reach further into project management domain
with Technology Preview Release of OpenL Tablets Web Studio. It features simple user-friendly browser-based
interface with multi-hierarchical view of project components, full-text search and indexing of Excel and Word files.
No matter how many Excel or Word<sup><a href="#discl2">(2)</a></sup> files your project has, they will be organized in a
hierarchical structured project view that is easy to navigate, search and explore. By leveraging OpenL <i>Click-to-Edit</i> 
approach Web Studio brings to business users all the advantages that before were only available to OpenL developers.

(1) The existential statements like <i>not available anywhere else</i> most probably reflect author's ignorance. 
There is always <i>something</i> somewhere. Please send me links or info regarding similar products, 
I will post it here

(2) For now Word files can be used only for search and indexing. Just put them somewhere inside your project and Studio will 
automatically find and index them. OpenL Tablets already have developed the technology for extraction of tables from Word 
documents, but it is not integrated yet with OpenL Plugin Project Builder. First things first

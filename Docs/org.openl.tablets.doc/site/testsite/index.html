<h2>27-Aug-2007. OpenL Tablets 4.1.1 released</h2>

<p>
Version 4.1.1 has significantly improved performance for certain 
types of the often used conditions. It contains announced earlier 
<a href="ws-benchmarks401.shtml">Performance Benchmarks</a>
that allow to measure and compare OpenL method performance interactively.
The changes make OpenL Tablets arguably <i>the fastest</i> Decision Table 
Engine among the existing Java rule engines.

<p>
The other changes include some usability improvements and a few minor bug fixes. For
more details refer to <a href="changelog.shtml">the change log</a> and other documentation.  





<h2>11-Jun-2007. OpenL Tablets 4.0.1 released</h2>

<p>Version 4.0.1 contains completely redesigned and upgraded <a href="ws-toc401.shtml">Web Studio</a>. 
It has been done with an intention to move project development and maintenance further toward the browser-based interface and 
improve business and technical user experience at the same time. 

<p>With OpenL Tablets Web Studio you now have an ability:

<li>View projects in different customizable <a href="ws-modes401.shtml">display modes</a> suitable for both business and technical audience
<li>Create <a href="ws-unit-tests401.shtml">Unit Tests</a> for OpenL Decision Tables and Methods, ran and trace them
<li>Display and explain the results of the Unit Tests and Runs
<li>Display compile- and run-time errors, providing links to the original Excel document
<li>Dynamically re-load of OpenL projects, including changes in the project classpath 
<li>Make table-oriented Advanced Search in addition to the full-text search that was available before

<p>

For the full list of the changes please refer to <a href="changelog.shtml">the change log</a> 



<p>
It's been a long time since the last update. The OpenL Tablets have been successfully used in many exciting new projects. 
Unfortunately, all these activities prevented us from the publishing of the new version earlier. 
Hopefully, it was worth the waiting. From now on we promise to shorten the update cycle and release 
the updates every 2-3 months. 
<p>
Despite the enormous amount of changes in this release, all the projects developed 
with the previous version(s) should remain compatible. 
<p>
For the full description of the Web Studio and OpenL Tablets functionality please refer to the Online Documentation

<p>

prototype of <a href="webstudio310.shtml">OpenL Tablets Web Studio</a>. It features browser-based integrated OpenL Project view,

<Web Studio provides hierarchical structured view of the OpenL Module Tables, grouping them either by table type 
or location. This feature is very convenient for projects with multiple Excel workbooks.

Web Studio provides a dual-view of the Decision Tables, one that's suitable for business users and another for developers. 
The browser view preserves the original Excel formatting.  

<p>
Web Studio incorporates full-text search and indexing of Excel and Word documents. Using familiar search-engine interface 
users can easily have all the project information at their fingertips.  <i>Link-to-Edit</i> technology positions

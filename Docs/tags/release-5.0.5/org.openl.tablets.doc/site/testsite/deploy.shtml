<h1>OpenL Tablets Deployment</h1>


<h2>Jar Files</h2>

To deploy OpenL Tablets in runtime environment one needs to place the following .jar files into application classpath 
(replace 4.1.1 with more recent version where applicable):
<p>
<code>
${plugins}/org.openl.commons_4.1.1.jar<br/>
${plugins}/org.openl.core_4.1.1.jar<br/>
${plugins}/org.openl.j_4.1.1.jar<br/>
${plugins}/org.openl.rules_4.1.1.jar<br/>
${plugins}/org.openl.rules.helpers_4.1.1.jar<br/>
${plugins}/org.openl.lib.apache.poi.modified_4.1.1.jar<br/>
${plugins}/org.openl.lib.apache.commons_4.1.1/commons-lang-1.0.1/commons-lang-1.0.1.jar<br/>
${plugins}/org.openl.lib.apache.commons_4.1.1/commons-logging-1.0.3/commons-logging-api.jar<br/>
${plugins}/org.openl.lib.apache.commons_4.1.1/commons-logging-1.0.3/commons-logging.jar<br/>
</code>

<h2>Excel Files</h2>

<p>
Excel files need to be present in deployment as well. 
OpenL Tablets may retrieve Excel files in runtime either from the file system or from classpath. 
If Excel files are to be retrieved from file system, 
the location where they would be retrieved from is called user home. 
If user home coincides with Java VM current directory, no further action is required. 
If user home is different from Java VM current directory, 
you need to set user home in Java Wrapper file before creating Java Wrapper instances.
</p>

<pre>
For example: 

<code>
MyProjectJavaWrapper.__userHome = "webapps/myapp/rules";

MyProjectJavaWrapper wrapper = new MyProjectJavaWrapper();
</code>
</pre>


<h2>Included Excel Files</h2>

OpenL Tablets Excel document may contain include instructions 
to include other documents in case of a large project. 
OpenL uses C-language convention for handling include files. 
If the name is double quoted, the path is relative to the main file's location. 
If the name is in angle brackets, the path is relative to includepath. 
By default includepath is <code>/include</code>. 
Deployed include files must comply with these rules. 



<h2>Project Classes</h2>

All project classes including dependencies and a (generated) 
Java Wrapper should be deployed according to common 
Java deployment practices for the particular deployment target.

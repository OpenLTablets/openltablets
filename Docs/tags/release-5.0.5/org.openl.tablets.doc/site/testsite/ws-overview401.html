<h1>Web Studio Overview</h1>

<p>The Webstudio allows users to browse OpenL Project structure, 
select Project Components, edit Project Components directly in Excel; 
in addition it can Run and Trace the Executable Components. The results of 
Run are displayed in the browser and are available to inspect. 



<p>
This document demonstrates and briefly explains how to use OpenL Tablets Web Studio. Starting with version 4.0.1 
Web Studio provides a better interface for developers to work with OpenL Tablets projects than the Eclipse plugin. 
It provides better error display, advanced features like visualizing unit test results, tracing and explanation.

 
<p>
We still use Eclipse to do some of work, in paticular - organize OpenL projects, compile java code, run Ant scripts, 
provide an interface to CVS etc. For all the activities related to the editing of the project's files, fixing errors, running, testing, 
benchmarking etc. we highly recommend using OpenL Web Studio.


<h2>General View</h2>

<p>
Web Studio General View consists of the three frames: 
<a href="#topmenu">Top Menu</a>, <a href="#pexplorer">Project Explorer</a> and <a href="#mainarea">Project Component View</a>
</p>

 
<img src="images/site/ws-general.png"/>



<h2><a name="topmenu">Top Menu</a></h2>

<p>
Top Menu Provides controls over Studio's most general tasks. It consists of  the following items: 

<p>
<ul>
<li>Project Selector combobox - allows to select any available OpenL Project in Web Studio workspace. 
If used with Eclipse IDE, Web Studio workspace coincides with Eclipse workspace. 
In this case combobox should contain all OpenL Projects. It is possible to use Web Studio in standalone mode(no Eclipse IDE).
In standalone mode the user will not have an option to recompile java classes of the project (we use Eclipse for this) but all 
other Studio's features will be available. 
 </li>

<li>
Studio Control Buttons:
<ul>
<li>
	<img border=0 src="images/business-view.png"> Business Mode - provides "business user friendly" view of the project. 
	It should be noted that Business Mode hides some of the project parts and table parts from the user. For more details on 
	Business Mode and how to control it's appearance look <a href="ws-modes401.shtml">here</a>   
</li>
<li>
	<img border=0 src="images/developer-view.png"> Developer Mode - provides full view of the project. 
	It is more suitable for a project developer/administartor.
</li>
<li>
	<img border=0 src="images/search.png"> Search - link to the project Search Page. OpenL will automatically index all 
	the documents in project's folder and provide an instant access to them via familiar internet-like search interface.
	In addition to the text search Web Studio now provides Advanced Search that provides table-specific search capabilities.
</li>
<li>
	<img border=0 src="images/refresh.gif"> Refresh - use this button if you a) changed any of the project files 
	b) recompiled any of the project's java classes using Eclipse IDE. Studio will reload the project, validate it 
	and display the new version.  
</li>
<li>
	<img border=0 src="images/help.gif"> Help - displays Studio online Help
</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>



<h2><a name="pexplorer">Project Explorer</a></h2>


<p>
The Project Explorer provides familiar tree-like view that allows users to browse project components. 
Usually one project component correspond to the one table in Excel. In the <a href="ws-modes401.shtml">Business Mode</a>
components are organized by <a href="ws-modes401.shtml#category">categories</a>. In the Developer Mode the components are organized 
by component's type or by component's location.  

<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project menu</h4>
<p>
On top of the Project Tree there is a Project Menu. It contains the following buttons:

<ul>
<li>
	<img border=0 src="images/test_ok.gif"/> Run All Tests - this button runs and displays all the <a href="ws-unit-tests401.shtml">unit tests</a> (if any) contained in the project. 
	It is recommended to run all the unit tests after you made any changes.    
</li>

<li>
	<img border=0 src="images/refresh.gif"> Refresh - use this button if you a) changed any of the project files 
	b) recompiled any of the project's java classes using Eclipse IDE. Studio will reload the project, validate it 
	and display the new version.  
</li>

<li>
	<img border=0 src="images/expandall.gif"/> Expand All - expands all tree branches

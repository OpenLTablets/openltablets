<h1>OpenL Project from the Java (Eclipse) developer's perspective</h1>

<p>
OpenL Project is basically a regular Eclipse Java Plug-in Project 
with few add-ons specific for the OpenL Tablets. 

<p><li>OpenL plugin provides "compilation" of OpenL
components. It is not a real compilation, in a sense, that it does not produce 
any files (at least for now), but it does a very thorough validation of the project's 
OpenL files and produces errors similar to the ones that any kind of the "real" 
compiler would produce.

<p><li>OpenL Project depends on a set of OpenL libraries (see project properties for details)

<p><li>OpenL Project contains OpenL files (usually Excel .xls files, but not necessarily). They are located in 
<b>rules/</b> folder, but it could be any of the projects <i>source</i> folders. Large OpenL projects may have
more complex directory structure involving separate folders for different parts of the project. OpenL files may contain 
the <i>include</i> directive, that works similarly to the C <i>include</i> directive that may be used to include 
files from any file ot net location.

<p><li>The <b>build/</b> folder contains files that are used by 
different tools. Usually it contains <b>GenerateJavaWrapper.build.xml</b>  file
that is used for Ant-based generation of Java wrapper file. By default Java Wrapper 
source code is placed in the <b>gen/</b> folder. 

<p><span  class="red">Note: After wrapper generation you need to <i>Refresh(F5)</i> the enclosing Java Project
to compile the generated code.</span>  

<p>The <b>build/</b> folder also contains file <b>openl.project.classpath.properties</b>. This file is also automatically
generated and contains project's classpath information, that is necessary for OpenL Web Studio to load the project properly. 

<p>
<h2>Eclipse Actions</h2>

<p>
To "compile" OpenL files using OpenL Eclipse Plugin just <i>Refresh(F5)</i> the project after you have changed and saved OpenL files using Excel.

<p>After you made changes in Java project files you nead to <i>Clean</i> the project to make OpenL Plugin to reload Java classes. This is not necessary
if you use Web Studio - it automatically reloads project's classpath each time you reload the project.

<p>
If you want changes in OpenL method signature be reflected in OpenL Java Wrapper class you need to run 
<i>Generate {project_name} Java Wrapper</i> from Eclipse <i>Run</i> menu.

<p>
<h2>OpenL Errors</h2>
<p>
OpenL Plugin displays compilation errors the same way as Java errors are displayed. Runtime OpenL errors will be displayed in Eclipse console 
in the form of "console hyperlinks". Clicking on a hyperlink will transfer you to the source of the error (usually to the cell that produced the error 
in Excel spreadsheet).

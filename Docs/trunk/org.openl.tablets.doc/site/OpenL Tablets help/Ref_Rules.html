In OpenL Tablets, a <b>rule</b> is a logical statement consisting of conditions and actions. If a rule
is called and all its conditions are true then the corresponding actions
are executed. Basically, a rule is an IF-THEN statement. The following
is an example of a rule expressed in human
language:
    </p>
 

    <p class="MsoBodyText">
<i>If a service request costs less than 1,000 dollars and takes less than 8
hours to execute then the service request must be approved
automatically.</i>
    </p>
 

    <p class="MsoBodyText">
Instead of executing actions, rules can also return data values to the
calling
program.

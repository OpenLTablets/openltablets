BEX supports a notation where an expression is written using simple
variables followed by the attributes they represent. For example, assume
the following expression is used in
Java:
    </p>
 

    <p class="MsoBodyText">
<code>(Agreed Value of the vehicle - Market Value of the vehicle) / Market
Value of the vehicle is more than Limit Defined
<span class="GramE">By</span> User</code>
    </p>
 

    <p class="MsoBodyText">
As can be seen from the example, the expression is hard to read.
However, the expression is much simpler if written according to the
notion of explanatory variables as
follows:
    </p>
 

    <p class="codelines">
<code>(A - M) / M &gt; X, where </code>
    </p>
 

    <p class="codelines">
<code>A - Agreed Value of the vehicle, </code>
    </p>
 

    <p class="codelines">
<code>M - Market Value of the vehicle, </code>
    </p>
 

    <p class="codelines">
<code>X - Limit Defined By User</code>
    </p>
 

    <p class="MsoBodyText">
This syntax is similar to the one used in scientific publications and is
much easier to read for complex expressions. It provides a good mix of
mathematical clarity and business
readability.

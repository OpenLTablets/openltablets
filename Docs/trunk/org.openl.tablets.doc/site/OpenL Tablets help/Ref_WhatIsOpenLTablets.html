<b>OpenL Tablets</b> is a rules management framework based on tables presented in Excel and
Word documents. Using unique concepts,
OpenL Tablets facilitates treating business documents containing business logic
specifications as executable source code. Since the format of tables
used by
OpenL Tablets is familiar to business users, OpenL Tablets bridges a gap between business users and developers, thus reducing
costly enterprise software development errors and dramatically
shortening the software development
cycle.
    </p>
 

    <p class="MsoBodyText">
In a very simplified view, OpenL Tablets can be considered as a table processor that extracts tables from Excel
and Word documents and makes them accessible from Java
programs.
    </p>
 

    <p class="MsoBodyText">
OpenL Tablets is built using the OpenL technology providing a framework for
development of different language
configurations.

The major advantages of using OpenL Tablets are as follows:

        <p>
<a name="OLE_LINK2"></a><a name="OLE_LINK1"></a>OpenL Tablets removes the gap between software implementation and
business documents, rules, and
policies.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li>

        <p>
Business rules become transparent to Java developers.
        </p>

      </li>

      <p class="listcontinue">
For example, decision tables are transformed into Java methods, and data
tables become accessible as Java data arrays through the familiar getter
and setter JavaBeans mechanism. The transformation is performed
automatically.
      </p>

      <li>

        <p>
OpenL Tablets verifies syntax and type errors in all project document
data, providing convenient and detailed error
reporting.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li>

        <p>
OpenL Tablets is able to directly point to a problem in an Excel or Word
document.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li>

        <p>
OpenL Tablets provides calculation explanation capabilities, enabling
expansion of any calculation result by pointing to source arguments in
the original
documents.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li>

        <p>
OpenL Tablets provides cross-indexing and search capabilities within all
project
documents.
        </p>

      </li>
    </ul>
       

    <p class="MsoBodyText">
OpenL Tablets supports the <code>.<span class="SpellE">xls</span></code> and <code>.doc</code> file formats.

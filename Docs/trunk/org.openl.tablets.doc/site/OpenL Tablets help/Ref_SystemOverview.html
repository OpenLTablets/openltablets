The following diagram shows how OpenL Tablets is used by different types of solution users:

The following is a typical lifecycle of an OpenL Tablets project:
    </p>
 

    <ol type=1>
      <li value=1>

        <p>
A rule developer creates a new OpenL Tablets project in Eclipse.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li value=2>

        <p>
In addition to the project itself, the rule developer also creates
correctly structured tables in Excel or Word files based on requirements
and includes them in the
project.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li value=3>

        <p>
A business user accesses tables in the OpenL Tablets project and defines
rules.
        </p>

      </li>

      <p class="listcontinue">
Typically, this task is performed through OpenL Web Studio in a web browser.
      </p>

      <li value=4>

        <p>
A rule developer performs unit tests and performance tests on rules
through advanced OpenL Web Studio
features.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li value=5>

        <p>
A developer who creates other parts of the solution employs business
rules directly through the OpenL Tablets engine or remotely through web
services.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li value=6>

        <p>
Whenever required, the business user updates or adds new rules to
project
tables.
        </p>

      </li>
    </ol>

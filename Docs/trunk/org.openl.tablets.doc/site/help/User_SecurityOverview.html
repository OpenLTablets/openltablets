OpenL Web Studio supports a security mechanism restricting access to certain product
functions based on user access rights. Each
OpenL Web Studio user is identified by a unique name. Users can have varied levels of
access in
OpenL Web Studio. For example, system administrators usually have full access to all OpenL Web Studio functions, whereas business users only have access rights to modify
business
rules.
    </p>
 

    <p class="MsoBodyText">
Usually, when a user opens OpenL Web Studio in the web browser, the user is automatically logged in using the
Windows&reg; account. If automatic logging in is not supported, a login
window is presented and the user name and password must be
specified.

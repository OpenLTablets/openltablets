It's been a long time since the last update. The OpenL Tablets have been successfully used in many exciting new projects. 
Unfortunately, all these activities prevented us from the publishing of the new version earlier. 
Hopefully, it was worth the waiting. From now on we promise to shorten the update cycle and release 
the updates every 2-3 months. 
<p>
Despite the enormous amount of changes in this release, all the projects developed 
with the previous version(s) should remain compatible.

<h1>OpenL Tablets Tutorial</h1>


<p>
OpenL Tablets Tutorials consists of the set of working Eclipse projects. Each Tutorial is well documented and demonstrates specific features of OpenL Tablets. You can run these tutorials, try different changes etc. It is strongly recommended that you go through at least first 3 tutorials in order to get familiar with OpenL Tablets basics.

<h2>Tutorial Installation</h2>

All the tutorials come pre-packaged as part of OpenL Tablets Eclipse plugin. 
To install the tutorial in your workspace simply go to Eclipse menu <b>File|New|Project</b>. 
Select folder <code>OpenL Tablets/Tutorials</code> and click on the tutorial you want to install. 


<h2>Learning by Running</h2>


We are convinced that the best way for the developer to learn new stuff is by example. 
Therefore, our tutorials present a comprehensive demonstration of major OpenL features. 
Moreover, we are committed to keep it this way with all the new exciting features. 
And, personally, it is much more satisfying for me to spend time on a working project, than trying to document it.
Fortunately, Excel provides such a nice array of documenting possibilities that we can have both - working self-documented project.
To make understanding easier we put a lot of comments inside Excel spreadsheets. 
Java code is also well documented. 
As an additional bonus, tutorials show you how to format your tables to underscore business logic using colors and bounds.

<p>
Some of the tutorials will require some interaction from you. 
For example, we specially designed tutorial that teaches error correcting techniques using OpenL Tablets Eclipse plugin. 
Another tutorial guides you through the basics of Eclipse edit/refresh/compile cycle that is required 
due to the fact that we use external editor (Excel or OpenOffice) to edit files.

<h2>  Tutorial 4 - UServ Product Derby</h2>

<pre>
This tutorial should be viewed as "the reference implementation" of the well-known <a href="http://www.businessrulesforum.com/2005_Product_Derby.pdf">Business Rules Forum 2005 challenge</a>. 

Even though it is not 100% finished yet, we decided to publish it because it demonstrates a lot of useful techniques for
developing and managing the medium-size projects. The Tutorial's updates will be available either from the project's 
CVS or as the part of the upcoming releases.

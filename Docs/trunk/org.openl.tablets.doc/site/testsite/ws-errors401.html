<h1>Error Handling in the Web Studio</h1>


<p>Version 4.0.1 possesses much better error handling capabilities than it's predecessor.
It is not only dipslys compile-time and run-time errors. but also points to the 
source of the problem in the Excel document.

<h2>Compile-time Errors</h2>

<p>The errors that we call "compile-time errors" are the ones captured by the  
OpenL during project loading. There are 2 distinct types of the compile-tiem errors:

<p><li>Configuration, classpath or any other "hard" errors that prevent 
the Web Studio from a correct instantiating of the Java Wrapper class instance.
<p>These errors are displayed in the project tree view stacktrace in the eclipse console:

<p>

<p><li>OpenL Errors are the errors in the syntax or semantics of the OpenL components. 
They are displayed as red marks on components in the Project View and as a red selection 
in the link to the offending OpenL source code. In the picture below you can see 
how the Web Studio dispalys an error in the Decision Table <b>modelYear</b>:

<p>
Click on the link; the Excel application will appear and position the cursor in the cell 
that has the error. After editing the Excel file and fixing the error, save it and Refresh the project in 
the Web Studio. If you are skillful or lucky, the red marks will disappear.


<h2>Run-time error</h2>

<p>
Once all the compile-time errors have been fixed, you can start the fun stuff - 
run unit tests or other Runnable Methods. And sometimes even the best system powered
by the most intelligent people will unexpectedly produce so-called run-time errors like NPE or 
AEDBZ.

<p>OpenL will capture these errors and displays them in the Web Studio, at the same time producing OpenL/Java 
Stack Trace in the Eclipse Console.

<p>
For example, in this (artificially manufactured) case an unit test produces AEDBZ 
when <b>result == 0</b>

<p>
This is how the same error looks like in the Eclipse Console, the marked hyperlink will open 
the Excel at exact location(cell) where the error had occurred:


<p><img border=0 src="images/site/ws-error4.png"/>

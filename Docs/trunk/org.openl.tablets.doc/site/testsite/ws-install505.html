<h1>OpenL Tablets Web Studio Installation</h1>

<p>
Web Studio 5.0.5 installation procedure has been significantly simplified.

and install this project in Eclipse workspace.  
<p>

<p>
<li>Point your browser to <a href="http://localhost:8080/webstudio/" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/webstudio/</a> or
just click this link. 


<h2>Opening single OpenL Project in Webstudio</h2>

The previous chapter described how to run Webstudio in your Eclipse workspace. In that mode all the projects will be available from the Webstudio.  
To browse just a single OpenL Project in Web Studio, right-click on that project in Eclipse and use menu <b>Edit in Webstudio</b>. 
To run another single project in Webstudio you will need to stop current Webstudio process in Eclipse console. 





<h3>Other Notes</h3>
<p>
OpenL Tablets Web Studio was developed under Mozilla Firefox 2 and also tested with IE Explorer 7. 
We used Office 2000 for office-related testing. In case if you have problems using Web Studio with other
configurations (unlikely) please report them to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openl-tablets/" target="_new"> project forums</a>.
<p>
Vista Users will need to save MS Office documents in MS Office 2000-3 format (POI library that we use to parse Office documents 
does not support new Office 2007 file format)

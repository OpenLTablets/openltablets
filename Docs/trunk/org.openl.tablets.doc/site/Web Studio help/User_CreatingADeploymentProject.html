    <p class="MsoBodyText">
Deployment to production time repository is performed by using
deployment projects. A deployment project is a list of rule projects and
specific project versions to be deployed together to production time
repository. Deployment projects are useful for recording the history of
project
deployments.
    </p>
 

    <p class="MsoBodyText">
Deployment projects are listed in the project tree, in the <b>Deployment Projects</b> category. Just like rule projects, deployment projects are stored in
design time repository and can be
versioned.
    </p>
 

    <p class="MsoBodyText">
To create a deployment project, proceed as follows:
    </p>
 

    <ol type=1>
      <li value=1>

        <p>
In the project tree, select the <b>Deployment Projects</b> category.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li value=2>

        <p>
In the right pane, click <b>Create New Deployment Project.</b>
        </p>

      </li>
      <li value=3>

        <p>
In the <b>New Deployment Project</b> window, enter the deployment project name and click <b>Create.</b>
        </p>

      </li>

      <p class="listcontinue">
The new deployment project appears in the project tree.
      </p>

      <li value=4>

        <p>
Define deployment project descriptors as described in <a href="User_DefiningDeploymentProjectDescriptors.html#_Defining_Deployment_Project">Defining Deployment Project Descriptors</a>.
        </p>

      </li>
    </ol>

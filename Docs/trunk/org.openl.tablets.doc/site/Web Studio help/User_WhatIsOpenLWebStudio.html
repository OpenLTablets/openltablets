    <p class="MsoBodyText">
<b>OpenL Web Studio</b> is a web application employed by business users and developers to view,
edit, and manage business rules and rule projects created using OpenL
Tablets technology. For information on OpenL Tablets, see
<i>OpenL Tablets Reference Guide.</i>
    </p>
 

    <p class="MsoBodyText">
Users can modify rules directly in a web browser without installing
additional tools
by using OpenL Web Studio. OpenL Web Studio provides better functionality than the OpenL Tablets Eclipse feature in
terms of browsing projects, modifying rules, viewing errors, and
executing tests. However, for more advanced activities, such as
compiling Java code, generating table wrappers, and running Ant scripts,
users must use
Eclipse.

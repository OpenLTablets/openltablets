Creating a Project with a Working Example of OpenL Maven Plugin Usage

  OpenL Tablets has an archetype which can be used to create a simple OpenL Tablets rules project containing an example
  of OpenL Maven plugin usage.


* OpenL Tablets Rules Project Archetype

  The current project is ready to deploy to OpenL Rule Services and provides an example of a pure OpenL Tablets rules project with separated main and test modules.

  [[1]] Execute the following command in the command line:

------------------------
  mvn archetype:generate
------------------------

  [[2]] Select the <<<openl-project-archetype>>> menu item and follow the wizard instructions to complete project creation.

  When a new Maven-based project is created, it appears in the file system:

    * The main OpenL Tablets project is located in the <<src/main/openl>> directory.

    * The test OpenL Tablets project is located in the <<src/test/openl>> directory.

    []

  The directory structure is described {{{./usage.html}here}}.

  [[3]] To compile the project, in the command line, execute the following command from the root of the project folder:

-------------
  mvn install
-------------

  []

  After that, the following objects can be found the <<<target>>> folder:

  * A ZIP file with the <<$\{project.artifactId\}-$\{project.version\}.zip>> name.

  This archive contains only the main project from the <<src/main/openl>> directory and can be deployed to the OpenL Tablets Rule Services.

  For more information, see [OpenL Tablets Rule Services Usage and Customization Guide].

  All test tables from the test project executed on the Maven <<test>> goal are not included to the final ZIP archive.

* Simple OpenL Tablets Project Archetype

  The current project uses OpenL Tablets engine to demonstrate how OpenL Tablets rules usage in a Java application.

  [[1]] Execute the following command in the command line:

------------------------
  mvn archetype:generate
------------------------

  Maven runs an archetype console wizard.

  [[2]] Select the <<<openl-simple-project-archetype>>> menu item.

  [[3]] Follow the wizard instructions to complete project creation.

  When a new Maven-based project is created, it appears in the file system.
  It is an OpenL Tablets rules project which has one module with simple rules.

  [[4]] To compile the project, in the command line, execute the following command from the root of the project folder:

-------------
  mvn install
-------------

  []

  After that, the following objects can be found the <<<target>>> folder:

  * A ZIP file without suffix for importing a project to OpenL Studio.

  For more information, see [OpenL Studio User Guide].

  * A ZIP file with "-runnable" suffix that can be executed after unpacking.

  It demonstrates how OpenL Tablets rules can be invoked from the Java code.

  * A JAR file that contains only compiled Java classes.

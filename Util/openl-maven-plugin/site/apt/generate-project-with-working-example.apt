Creating a Project with a Working Example of OpenL Maven Plugin Usage

  OpenL Tablets has an archetype which can be used to create a simple OpenL Tablets rules project containing an example
  of OpenL Maven plugin usage.

* Simple OpenL project archetype

  Current project uses OpenL dynamic wrapper to show how OpenL rules can be used in java application.

  [[1]] Execute the following command in the command line:

------------------------
  mvn archetype:generate
------------------------

  Maven runs an archetype console wizard.

  [[2]] Select the <<<openl-simple-project-archetype>>> menu item.

  [[3]] Follow the wizard instructions to complete project creation.

  When the new Maven-based project is created, it appears in the file system.
  It is an OpenL Tablets rules project which has one module with simple rules.

  [[4]] To compile the project, in the command line, execute the following command from the root of the project folder:

-------------
  mvn install
-------------

  After that, the following objects can be found the <<<target>>> folder:

  * A ZIP file without suffix for importing a project to OpenL Tablets WebStudio.

  For more information, see [OpenL Tablets WebStudio User Guide].

  * A ZIP file with "-runnable" suffix that can be executed after unpacking.

  It demonstrates how OpenL Tablets rules can be invoked from the Java code.

  * A JAR file that contains only compiled Java classes.

* OpenL rules project archetype

  Current project is ready to deploy to OpenL Rule Services and shows an example of pure OpenL rules project with separated main and test modules.

  [[1]] Execute the following command in the command line:

  ------------------------
    mvn archetype:generate
  ------------------------

  [[2]] Select the <<<openl-project-archetype>>> menu item then follow the wizard instructions to complete project creation.

  When the new Maven-based project is created, it appears in the file system:

  * The main OpenL project are located in <<src/main/openl>> directory.

  * The test OpenL project are located in <<src/test/openl>> directory.

  [[3]] To compile the project, in the command line, execute the following command from the root of the project folder:

  -------------
    mvn install
  -------------

  After that, the following objects can be found the <<<target>>> folder:

  * ZIP file with <<${project.artifactId}-${project.version}.zip>> name.

  This archive contains only main project from <<src/main/openl>> directory and can be deployed to the OpenL Rules Services.
  For more information, see [Rule Services Usage and Customization Guide].
  All test tables from the test project are executed on Maven <<test>> goal aren't included to the final ZIP archive.

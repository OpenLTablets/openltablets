You should add to your ~/.m2/settings.xml the following server declaration:

<settings>
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>sourceforge</id>
            <username>your-login,openl-tablets</username>
            <password>your-password</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>

Replace "your-login" and "your-password" with correct values.
After that you can execute the "publish.cmd".

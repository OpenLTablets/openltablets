 *  The object is the reference to the current rule that is being executed at the moment.
 *  Currently it is valid only inside of the action that is being executed. The object facilitates 
 *  the access from the action method to the variables defined in conditions of the same rule
 *  
 *  In the future we may want to provide similar functionality inside conditions as well,
 *  but it may not be easy because of the indexing and optimization.

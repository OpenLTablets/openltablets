 * The interface IVocabulary has a special meaning. The instances of the interface is going to be used by multiple OpenL Tablets tools.
 * <p>
 * It's main function is to provide a set of <i>instrumented</i> types that later can be used in all OpenL components. 
 * <p>
 * Even though generic OpenL provides a wider possibilities to define types than conventional Java, the most of types used in OpenL 
 * are POJOs. As such they contain minimum of meta-information. The use of Java annotations is limited to Java programmers. The intention
 * of IVocabulary interface is to provide means for business users to define meta-information for Business Objects. At the same time it provides 
 * enough freedom for developers to define custom types and plug them in.
 * <p> 
 * The instrumentation enhances OpenL Types (usually derived from POJO) can be done through using a separate OpenL Tablets module. The "vocabulary"
 * module can be shared between multiple OpenL projects.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <h2>Configuration</h2>
 * <p>
 * IVocabulary implementation must be a public class with public default constructor located in project's classpath. In case, when the implementation is
 * just plain Java, this will suffice. In more probable case the class will be based on OpenL Tablets module(the domains will be defined in .xls 
 * file by business users using either Data or Decision Tables). In this case the special care should be taken about proper location of .xls file, because
 * the module can be defined in a different Eclipse project. By default, the files are located in <code>rules/</code> folder. This works fine, 
 * if the vocabulary module is located in the same project as the main project. In case if the vocabulary project is separate(often the case when 
 * vocabulary is shared) the location should be defined using that project's name: <code>../my.vocabularyproject/rules/MyVocabulary.xls</code>. 
 * The change needs to be made in <code>build/GenerateJavaWrapper.build.xml</code> file. 
 *

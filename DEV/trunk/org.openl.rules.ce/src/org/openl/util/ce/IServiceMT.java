/**
 * 
 * This is the central point of everything parallel multi-threaded execution in
 * OpenL MT framework
 * 
 * 
 * The only goal of the parallel framework is to increase performance vs
 * single-threaded execution. It is done by utilizing the number of available
 * CPU cores.
 * 
 * The tricky part comes from the fact that this resource is shared between
 * different applications and threads, not only within a single JVM but also
 * outside of the JVM boundaries. In the real life we may expect different usage
 * scenarios and get different results with the same algorithms. Also, we know
 * that different hardware platforms and different versions of the JVMs may
 * demonstrate different performance characteristics.
 * 
 * All this knowledge regarding the task complexity should not preclude us from
 * attempting to work on parallel execution of the different parts of the OpenL
 * framework. As number of cores in commercial CPUs grows every year, even
 * mediocre algorithms will produce a significant improvement in performance,
 * without being optimal.
 * 
 * At this point we have the following classes of tasks as candidates for
 * parallel execution:
 * 
 * 1) Symmetrical array processing. A subset of embarrassingly parallel problems
 * where each element has approximately the same computational complexity.
 * Examples: <li>Runtime: MultiCall processing: applying the same method to an
 * array of arguments {@link MultiCallMethodBoundNode}. Such as processing array
 * of vehicles within an insurance policy rating algorithm, or processing array
 * of coverages within a single vehicle in the same algorithm <li>Parsing:
 * Processing an array of rows in a table
 * 
 * This case requires a minimal effort to efficiently schedule the execution.
 * The only issue here is defining proper minimal efficient size of the
 * sequential execution.
 * 
 * 2) Asymmetrical array processing. Each element has possibly different
 * complexity, it is still possible to estimate the complexity of the task
 * beforehand Examples: <li>Parsing: worksheets within a workbook <li>Parsing:
 * Tables
 * 
 * The approach here would be to schedule the longest tasks first, this should
 * provide good enough performance characteristics (need to verify)
 * 
 * 3) Tasks with static dependency graphs Examples: <li>Spreadsheets
 * 
 * The approach is to use critical path scheduling and dynamic execution
 * 
 * 4) Tasks with dynamic dependencies Examples: <li>Parsing of included
 * workbooks
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The additional goals of the framework are the following:
 * 
 * 1) Provide a single configuration management mechanism for parallel execution
 * of different types of activities 2) Use simple API for different cases 3)
 * Optimize parallel performance using static and dynamic information
 * 
 * In the future we may provide more features to improve scheduling of tasks
 * based on priorities and different SLA requirements, but initially we just
 * want to increase the performance in simple cases, get low-hanging fruits

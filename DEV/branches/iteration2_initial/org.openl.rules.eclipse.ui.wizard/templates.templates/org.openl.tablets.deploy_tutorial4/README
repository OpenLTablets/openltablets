Prerequisites:

You need to have OpenL plugins installed in eclipse

Replace next properties in build file:
<property name="plugin.base.path" value="C:/Eclipse/plugins" />
<property name="openl.plugin.version" value="_5.0.5" />

with values valid for your environment:
<property name="plugin.base.path" value="<path to eclipse plugins directory where OpenL plugins are located>" />
<property name="openl.plugin.version" value="_<version of OpenL installed>" />

Notice: version should be with "_" (underscore) prefix.

Using:
ant start_tomcat      - starts tomcat server with webstudio and demo web applications
ant start_ruleservice - starts ruleservice

Note:
  Start ruleservice a while after tomcat is started as it hosts a JCR production repository available through 
RMI, to which both webstudio and ruleservice connect.


webstudio should available at url http://localhost:8080/webstudio
and demo web application (very simple) at url   http://localhost:8080/demo

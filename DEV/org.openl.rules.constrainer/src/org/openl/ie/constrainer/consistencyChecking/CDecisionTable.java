 * <p>Title: </p>
 * <p>Description: Interface for gaining access to the data of the Decision Table.</p>
 * <p>
 * Decision Table is represented as a matrix consisted of m columns - variables and n rows - rules.
 * Thus the entry with coordinates [i,j] is a constraint imposed by i'th rule on the j'th variable.
 * The conjunction of all the constraint situated in the same row called "Rule". Formally speaking,
 * rule is an area in the space of states which bounds are due to the constraints being part of it.

<h1>Welcome To OpenL Tablets Web Studio</h1>

We are definitely not in sales and therefore can not promise that using OpenL Tablets Web Studio one day get you into haven, 
but it for sure will put you in a <i>managerial position</i>.

<p>
This is a <a href="#prototype">prototype</a> version of future OpenL Tablets Web Studio. 

<p>
Your feedback is very important. Don't hesitate and post your questions and comments in 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openl-tablets/" target="_new">project's</a> forums. 




<h2>Goals</h2>

Excel spreadsheets have been long proven to be a superior editor for different kinds of tables, including
the ones that we use in OpenL Tablets. 
On the other hand, Excel provides next to nothing abilities for table management. 
OpenL Tablets allows you to have multiple Excel (and soon Word) files in your OpenL project, 
and this is a good thing - it allows you to distribute the logic the way it is structured, 
using multiple workbooks and worksheets. 
But once you have many Excel workbooks of a notable size you need a tool that gives you better 
management capabilities.

<p>
Therefore the first goal of Web Studio is to provide an integrated view of OpenL Tablets project. 

<p>
The second goal is to provide easy navigation between different project components.       

<p>
The third goal is to provide full-text search, indexing and cross-referencing of all the related components

<p>
In a future, Web Studio should provide server-based managed access to all the project components, 
including ability to access repository, edit rules directly in a browser etc. 
For now it provides single-user interface for local project management


<h2>What's in this release?</h2>


<h3>Module Tree View</h3>

<p>
Module Tree View provides structured view of OpenL Tablets Module. There are two main branches in the tree - 
<code>By Type</code> and <code>By File</code>. They represent two different hierarchical views of the Module. 

<p>
Web Studio scans your workspace and automatically finds all available OpenL Tablets Modules. 
You can select the module you want to browse from the combobox

<p>
As we expect from OpenL Tablets, the smallest project component showing up in the Module Tree is a table. 
Once you click on the table it appears in a Table View

<h4>Synchronization with changes made outside of the studio</h4>

If you edit you project files in Excel you may synchronize it with Project View by clicking <code>Refresh</code> icon 
on the top menu bar 



<h3>Table View</h3>

<p>
Table View tries to display the table more or less the way it is presented in the original Excel document. You can view 
(some) tables in 2 modes - with or without OpenL Tablets Header. The latter is more suitable for business users. 
Switching between modes is done by clicking an appropriate icon on the top menu bar

<p>
Table View provide you with a link to the original Excel document. Clicking on this link will start Excel 
and position cursor at the table's location 

<h3><a name="search">Search and Index</a></h3>

<p>
All the project documents (Excel and Word) are automatically indexed and available for full-text search. 
To start search click <code>Search</code> icon on the top menu bar. For example, if you add your requirements document into 
OpenL project, it will become indexed and searchable too. 

<p>
Search is word-based and case-insensitive. It is currently English-language oriented and may produce strange effects 
when used with other languages (try it anyway). Sometimes English results seem strange too :)

<p>
To search for a phrase put it in double quotes. To exclude results with particular word put '-' before it    
 
<p>
Index view is reachable from search view. It contains indexed list of all the words in alphabetical order


<p>

You can access the original document by clicking on the link provided by Search or Index view. As always, it will start 
Excel or Word application and position cursor at the search result's location. 
We call this technology <i>Link-to-Edit</i>. 
It was first introduced in Eclipse plugin and now is available from  web browser interface.

Please select a project on the left and start exploring


<h2>Known Limitations</h3>
<li>Web Studio <i>Link-to-Edit</i> technology will work only on MS Windows and with MS Office</li><br/>
<sup>Some community help is wanted in order to support OpenOffice - it will make OpenL Tablets truly platform-independent</sup>
<li>Web Studio will work only with "valid" OpenL Modules. Fix all the errors using Eclipse and Excel</li>
<li>Web Studio may not show some OpenL Projects created by prior versions of OpenL Tablets. 
To fix this you need to run <i>Generate ${my.project} Wrapper</i> procedure in Eclipse Run menu</li>
<li>Editing tables in web browser is not available yet. The recent exciting developments at 
<a href="http://www.softwaregarden.com/wkcalpha/" target="_new">wikiCalc</a> and  
<a href="http://www.google.com/googlespreadsheets/tour1.html" target="_new">Google</a> 
give us a clue what kind of spreadsheet editing is possible in a browser. 
We will wait and see (we need it for server-based managed editing), may be something open and free comes our way.</li>


<p>
<h2><a name="prototype">Prototype Version</a></h2>

We call it a prototype because
<li>It's development is not finished, some functionality will be added or improved later</li>
<li>Some functionality will be changed or removed in the future</li>
<li>Testing is not complete</li>
<li>No final decision has been made regarding packaging and distribution</li>
<li>Documentation is somewhat limited</li>

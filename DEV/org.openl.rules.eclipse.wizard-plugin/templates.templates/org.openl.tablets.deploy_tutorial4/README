Prerequisites:

You need to checkout to the same directory projects

org.openl.lib.apache.jackrabbit
org.openl.lib.apache.tomcat
org.openl.lib.cxf
org.openl.lib.jsf
org.openl.lib.springsource

OR 

Replace paths to libraries in build file:
".." should be changed with path to plugin directory in eclipse where OpenL Plugins are installed.
Also at the end of each library name the installed version should be put.
E.g. replace <property name="project.lib.jsf" value="../org.openl.lib.jsf" />
with: <property name="project.lib.jsf" value="C:/eclipse/plugins/org.openl.lib.jsf_5.0.5" /> 


Using:
ant start_tomcat      - starts tomcat server with webstudio and demo web applications
ant start_ruleservice - starts ruleservice

Note:
  Start ruleservice a while after tomcat is started as it hosts a JCR production repository available through 
RMI, to which both webstudio and ruleservice connect.


webstudio should available at url http://localhost:8080/webstudio
and demo web application (very simple) at url   http://localhost:8080/demo

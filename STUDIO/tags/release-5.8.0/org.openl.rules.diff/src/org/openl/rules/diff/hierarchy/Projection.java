 * Projection of an artifact.
 * <p>
 * The Projection can be considered as one of many Views of any object.
 * <p>
 * A Projection shows some properties of actual artifact and can hides others,
 * that are not relevant to domain of the Projection.
 * <p>
 * Also Projection can have own hierarchy of sub elements which can be
 * completely different from hierarchy of physical artifact.
 * <p>
 * Child of the Projection is Projection that allows multiple views on
 * each element depending on its position in hierarchy. But that can lead to
 * extreme memory allocation also. This feature should be used with care.

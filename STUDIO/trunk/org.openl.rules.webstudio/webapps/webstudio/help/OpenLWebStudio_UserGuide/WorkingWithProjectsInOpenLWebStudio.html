<span class="SpellE">OpenL</span> Web Studio is intended for a multi-user environment. It provides a centralized
storage of rule projects called

projects directly in design time repository. Instead, to make
modifications to a project, users must execute the following

Checking in a project copies user&#39;s workspace modified copy to

design time repository. A project can be restored to any of its previous

In addition to checking out and checking in projects, users can also
open and close them. An open project is copied from design time
repository to user&#39;s workspace, but the user cannot modify its
contents. If a user only wants to view contents of a project, opening
the project is recommended instead of checking it out. A checked out
project is locked for editing by other
users.

    <p class="MsoBodyText">
Closing a project deletes it from user&#39;s workspace but does not
affect the version in design time repository. Closed projects can be
browsed in repository editor but are not available in rule
editor.

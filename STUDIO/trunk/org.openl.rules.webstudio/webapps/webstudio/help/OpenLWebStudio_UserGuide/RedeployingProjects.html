OpenL Web Studio provides a function that allows a simple update and redeployment of
many related deployment projects when a particular rule project is
modified. This function takes into account the version of the opened
rule project and works correctly, even with older project
versions.
    </p>
 

    <p class="MsoBodyText">
To update related deployment projects and redeploy a rule project,
proceed as
follows:
    </p>
 

    <ol type="1">
      <li value="1">

        <p>
In the project tree, select the modified rule project.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li value="2">

        <p>
In the right pane, click <b>Redeploy.</b>
        </p>

      </li>

      <p class="Note">
<b>Note:</b> The <b>Redeploy</b> button is disabled if the selected project is a local project or if it
is checked
out.
      </p>

      <p class="listcontinue">
The <b>Auto Redeploy</b> window appears listing all existing deployment projects whose latest
version contains a reference to the selected rule project. Deployment
projects marked for deletion are not
displayed.

The <b>Message</b> column displays the current status of displayed deployment projects. If
a particular deployment project cannot be redeployed, the check box in
the
<b>Selected</b> column is gray. Following are possible reasons for a deployment project
to be
disabled:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>

          <p>
The deployment project is checked out.
          </p>

        </li>
        <li>

          <p>
The deployment project is locked by another user and cannot be updated.
          </p>

        </li>
        <li>

          <p>
The deployment project is up to date and references the selected version
of the rule
project.
          </p>

        </li>
        <li>

          <p>
The deployment project references a version of the rule project that is
higher than the one currently
opened.
          </p>

        </li>

        <p class="listcontinue">
If the selected rule project is not referenced by any existing
deployment project, the system offers to create a new deployment project
containing only the rule project with an identical
name.
        </p>

      </ul>

      <li value="3">

        <p>
Select check boxes for the deployment projects that must be updated and
redeployed.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li value="4">

        <p>
Click <b>Redeploy.</b>
        </p>

      </li>

      <p class="listcontinue">
Update and redeployment results are displayed in the user interface.
